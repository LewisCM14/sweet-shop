                    <p>
                        A newly established, online sweet company founded in 2020 by Augustine Evanson. With a mission to serve
                        customers their <strong>favorite childhood sweets.</strong> In the wake of the 2019 pandemic Augustine wanted to start a
                        business that could be insulated from a new, ever changing, climate, whilst also wanting to bring
                        comfort back into the lives of people. Thus, <strong>Classic Confectionary</strong> was born.

                        Catering to Millennials and for some of the early ones, now their children as well, we strive to stock
                        <strong>childhood favorites</strong> of the highest quality. At great <strong>value for money.</strong> All packaged in sustainable
                        material, with <strong>tracked, free delivery available on orders.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Classic Confectionary</strong> now finds itself in a dedicated warehouse and packing facility with a team of
                        enthusiastic individuals. Being of the 'internet generation' we're aware that the Woolworths pick & mix
                        section is no longer the place to go for a sweet treat (This setup definitely would't fly in the new
                        socially distanced era). Everything is online now and delivered almost instantly and our aim is to bring
                        those sweet treats to your door whilst protecting customers data and adhering to the highest hygiene
                        standards and we're proud to make that happen!
