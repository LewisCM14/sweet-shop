def all_products(request):
    """
    A view to show all products

    Search Functionality:
    Handles the search function in the main nav.
    Takes in the GET request from the form,
    storing the input named as 'q' in the query variable.
    If no value is input, an error message is returned
    and the user is redirected to the prodcuts url.
    If there is a value input, the queries variable is set
    equal to a Q object, where the name or the description,
    contains the query (case insensitive).
    The products variable is then filtered by the queries variable.

    Type Filtering:
    Takes in the type_query from the GET request,
    storing the required type value in the type_filter variable.
    Then filters the products returned in the view by the name value
    of the type_filter. Then converts the list of strings of type names
    passed through the URL into a list of actual type objects,
    so that all their fields can be accessed in the template.

    Year Filtering:
    Filtering by year takes in the GET request, then uses an if/else
    statement to filter prodcuts by the years_popular fields, based on
    the value given in the request.

    Product Sorting:
    Takes in the sort criteria from the GET request.
    Storing it in the sortkey variable for use in the function,
    whilst also preserving the original sort criteria in a variable
    for use in the template.

    Then checks if direction was in the GET request.
    Prepending a minus to the sortkey variable if the direction was
    equal to descending (desc) Before ordering the products by the
    final sortkey variable.
